#What is VM VirtualBox?

VirtualBox is a platform for visualization applications and is a hosted hypervisor for x86 virtualization. It is developed by Oracle Corporation. It can run multiple operating systems simultaneously and is quite easy to install. Using this, the user can install and run as many virtual machines as he likes.

Features – 

This software runs on a large number of the 64-bit host OS.

It provides pretty good hardware support.

It gives a group feature for users to organize and control virtual machines altogether and individually also.

It’s a modular design with a well-structured programming interface.

The (VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension) enables high-performance remote access.

# vm-automation
Python script that can be used to test software/scripts/etc on VMs (currently only VirtualBox is supported).

Both Windows and Linux are supported as host OS.

# Configuration
* vms_list - list of VMs to use. Example: ['w10_x64', 'w10_x86', 'w81_x64', 'w81_x86', 'w7_x64', 'w7_x86']
* snapshots_list - list of snapshots to use. Example: ['java8', 'java11', 'office2013', 'office2016', 'office2019']
* vm_gui - start VM with GUI (vm_gui = 'gui') or without GUI (vm_gui = 'headless')
* vboxmanage_path - path to 'vboxmanage' executable. On Windows you can leave it as-is and add VirtualBox'es folder in $PATH. Example: 'vboxmanage'
* vm_guest_username - login for guest OS. Example: 'user'
* vm_guest_password - password for guest OS. Example: 'P@ssw0rd'
* remote_folder - directory, where executable is uploaded (on guest host). Example: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Desktop\\\\'
* vm_network_state - option to enable (vm_network_state = 'on') or disable (vm_network_state = 'off') network on guest VM
* vm_guest_resolution - change screen resolution on guest. Example: vm_guest_resolution = '1024 768 32'
* preexec - application or script to run before main file. Example: preexec = 'notepad.exe'
* postexec - application or script to run after main file. Example: postexec = 'notepad.exe'
* timeout - global timeout for all vboxmanage commands (seconds). Example: 60
* calculate_hash - calculate sha256 hash of file. Example: calculate_hash = 1
* show_links - show links for VirusTotal and Google search. Example: show_links = 1

# Usage
python vm-automation.py binary.exe

# TODO:
* Control how many threads run simultaneously (currently equals to number of VMs)
